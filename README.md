NASA Farm Navigators: Using NASA Data Exploration in Agriculture

The agriculture community faces the challenge of integrating technology and data to enhance sustainable farming practices. Simulating key farming activities like fertilizing, irrigating, and livestock management using real-world NASA satellite imagery and climate data can enable better understanding of the impacts of these variables on crop production. Your challenge is to create an engaging educational game that effectively utilizes NASAâ€™s open data sets to simulate farming scenarios and enables players to learn how this data can inform innovative, sustainable, agricultural methods.
